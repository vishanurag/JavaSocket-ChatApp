## Features

- Using this application we can communicate within the same network.
- This acts as a personal chatting app which no-one else can track.

## Tech Used

- I have used Java's Socket Programming concepts inorder to make this application.



## Installation
In-order to use my Java Socket based ChatApp in your local machine, you need to follow these steps:

- Just clone or download this repository.
- Firstly run following commands inside the `Server` directory.
```
javac Main.java
java Main
```
- Then run the same commands inside the `Client` directory.
```
javac Main.java
java Main
```
- That's it! You will get messages i.e, `Server Connected` and `Client Connected` in both of your terminals.
- Now you can start chatting with both terminals instances.
- Here is the preview
